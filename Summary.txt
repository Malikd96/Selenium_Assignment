✅ Selenium Automation Project Summary Report
Project Name: Hello_World_Selenium_Project
Author: Malik Davis
Date: April 23, 2025

🧪 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates a complete Selenium automation framework using Java, Maven, TestNG, and Apache POI. It includes multiple automation tasks such as basic and advanced browser automation, data-driven testing using Excel, and integration of TestNG test structures.

📌 Key Components Implemented:
1. BasicAutomation.java
Launches a browser and navigates to Wikipedia.

Validates page title and captures a screenshot.

2. AdvancedAutomation.java
Demonstrates interaction with dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and alerts.

Implements both implicit and explicit waits.

3. TestAutomationTest.java
Uses TestNG to structure tests with @BeforeMethod, @Test, and @AfterMethod.

Executes a simple automated browser task and generates TestNG reports.

4. DataDrivenTest.java
Reads search terms from an Excel file (testdata.xlsx) using Apache POI.

Performs dynamic browser searches and prints result page titles for each term.

⚙️ Tools & Dependencies:
Java 17

Maven 3.9.6

Selenium 4.8.0

TestNG 7.4.0

Apache POI 5.2.3

🧠 What I Learned:
How to build automation scripts using Selenium WebDriver in Java.

How to structure a Maven-based automation project.

How to read Excel data using Apache POI.

How to run and report tests using TestNG.

How to debug and resolve runtime and build-time errors.

🔧 Challenges Faced:
Initial issues with Java version and environment setup.

Errors related to TestNG imports due to missing dependencies.

Excel not found or invalid format errors.

ChromeDriver CDP warnings and WebSocket connection issues (resolved by allowing proper permissions and ensuring browser compatibility).

✅ Status:
All test classes were compiled and executed successfully. Screenshots were captured, Excel data was read correctly, and automated flows worked as expected.
